## Setup
To setup the cookie banner just put the `cookie-banner` snippet right befor your closing body tag. Thats it. üéâ
``` php
<?php snippet('cookie-banner') ?>
```
If a selection is made in the cookie modal, a corresponding event is fired on `<body>`.

| Event | Reason |
|---|---|
| `cookies:all` | all cookies are accepted |
| `cookies:deny` | only essential cookies are accepted |
| `cookies:custom` | some cookies are accepted |

Every event contains a comma separated string of selected options.
You can set these up in your `config.php` file under `site/config/`.
````php
return [
    'michnhokn.cookie-banner' => [
        'features' => [
            'analytics' => 'Analytics',
            'mapbox' => 'Mapbox'
        ]
    ]
];
````

## Methods
- `isFeatureAllowed(string $featureName)` Checks if a user allowed given feature
```php
<?php if (isFeatureAllowed('analytics')): ?>
    <h1>Analytics allowed</h1>
<?php endif; ?>
```
- `getAllowedFeatures()` Get all allowed features or false if nothing is selected
- `clearAllowedFeatures()` Clear all allowed features
